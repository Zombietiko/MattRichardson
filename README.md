# MattRichardson

I am coming to the end of my Fullstack developer diploma
and ewanted to create a folio site. 

Please find a live demo at this link,[click here](https://zombietiko.github.io/MattRichardson/)

I found two templates I liked and merged them together and then put a couple of my own elements to the site. 

These templates can be found:
